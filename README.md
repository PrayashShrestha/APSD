## TASK 2 Related to Spring Boot

---

- What is Spring?

Spring is a Java toolbox that makes building apps easier with ready-made tools for common tasks like database access and web development.

---

- What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a simplified version of Spring that sets everything up for you quickly, so you can start coding with less configuration.

---

- What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring Boot?

The Spring platform is the whole family of tools, and Spring Boot is a part of it, built on top to make Spring easier and faster to use.

---

- What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring framework?

The Spring platform is the big ecosystem, and the Spring framework is its core—the foundation that everything else in the platform builds on.

---

- What is Dependency Injection and how is it done in the Spring platform/framework?

Dependency Injection (DI) is when Spring gives a class the tools it needs (like a database connection) instead of the class creating them itself.

---

- What is Inversion of Control (IoC) and how is it related to Spring?

Spring does DI by using a configuration file or annotations (like @Autowired) to automatically “inject” the tools into your code.
